I was at the Flughafen. I saw Gauss driving his BMW on the Hauptstrasse. He was listening to some Musik and turned up the Klimaanlage. 
He decided to stop by the Baeckerei. He purchased a Gebaeck, but as soon as he walked outside it was stolen by a Hund, crushing his spirit.
He just went back and go a Brot instead. He spilt crumbs all over his lederhosen.
